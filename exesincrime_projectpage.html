								<h2>Editor Tools</h2>
								<p>
									Reasoning why editor tools - 		
									I wrote editor tools: Map editor, Dialog editor
								</p>
								<h3>Map Editor</h3>
								<p>
									<!--
										<span class="image left"><img src="images/exes_in_crime/map_editor_gif.gif" alt="" /></span>
									-->	
									<div class="video-container" style="left:12.5%;padding-bottom: calc(56.25% * .75);width: 75%;">
										<img src="images/exes_in_crime/map_editor.gif" alt="" />
									</div>
									To allow fast level creation and iteration - Helper tool to place floor tiles and wall tiles on grid of map object - two grid options: floor grid and wall grid for inbetween the floor tiles - References prefabs from then resource folder
									<br>
									Prefabs can contain information for the initial state of the tile. E.g. if a window or door can be passed through or is locked and has to be opened in game before the player can walk through them.
									<br>
									The prefabs of the tiles are also used to allow for instanced rendering of the meshes used for the tiles. Enhancing performance significantly.					
								</p>
								<h3>Dialog Editor</h3>
								<p>
									<div class="video-container" style="left:12.5%;padding-bottom: calc(56.25% * .75);width: 75%;">
										<img src="images/exes_in_crime/dialog_editor.PNG" alt="" />
									</div>
									To give narrative designer a more accesible tool to create, test and iterate over the many conversations the game has. 
									- Scriptable object approach makes  it possible to save changes, which are made when testing conversations during play mode. 
									- Dialog objects contain information about the displayed text, the two sprites which are going to be displayed and an optional voiceline to play. 
									The editor window allows to edit those values in a more cleanly structured way than editing the array of textboxes directly in the editor. 
									The designer can also add and delete textboxes and change the order they get presented.

									<h2>Game Systems</h2>
									<p>
										
										Handy Dandy has only a few and also simple systems, which the entire game is build upon. 
										The characters themselves are pretty much the most basic platformer characters imaginable. 
										They only listen to three inputs: Left, Right and Jump. 
										We decided to use the rigidbody physics system of Unity, as we wanted the players to be able to influence each other in a straight forward and easily understandable way. 
										With that the players can help each other through the levels by using the other character as a platform.
										<br>
										<br>
										A bit more tricky is how the levels of handy dandy work. 
										Each character has their own layout which are layered over each other and they only collide with the objects in 'their dimension'. 
										The splitscreen effect gets achieved through a mask that is attached to the barrier which always stays in the middle between the characters.
										<br>
										<br>
										At later stages in the game minecarts and little moles are introduced, which both allow for more interesting level designs by having moving/movable crystals.
									</p>
									<h3>Strategy Game</h3>
